=head1 NAME

moglistfids -- Iterate fid/key data from a MogileFS installation

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Example utility for pulling all file data out of a MogileFS installation.
Utilities like this can be built on for creating backup systems,
Mogile<->Mogile synchronization systems, or Mogile->S3 synchronization.

This method is only a way of pulling new files which have existed since the
last time it was checked, as there's no logging of deleted files.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over

=item --trackers=host1:7001,host2:7001

Use these MogileFS trackers to negotiate with.

=item --fromfid=<fid>

The highest numbered fid fetched the last time this utility was run.

=item --count=<count>

Numer of fids to inspect and return.
